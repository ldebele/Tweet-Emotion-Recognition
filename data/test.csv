i thought i was the only one who felt this way that a life outside of words is unbearable until i read an essay by another writer who spends most of his life in his writing room and then i felt maybe i wasnt the only person in the world who feels grumpy when taken out of the wash of words
i feel calm with the silent acceptance that the dying seem to display
i feel frustrated with myself my eating habits and my overall self
i always feel most sympathetic to ideas and social programs that try to reduce the number of abortions because i can see how they are really helping people rather than spending time and money on endless debate
im feeling mentally and emotionally exhausted from it all and i can tell i desperately need a vacation before i break
i feel like an inadequate mother i blame her
i feel thankful that weve been able to take painful heartbreaking things that have happened to us and rise above turning them into good
i could feel distressed and look into my soul to try to work out what i could have done to offend him
im not very well and im also feeling totally greedy and lethargic
i have absolutely no idea what means to feel morose
i had a nagging feeling all day that i missed something here
i feel so petty but it really upsets me
i feel im looking for someone and not trusting in god to find me a life partner said another
i hate him for making me feel the pain for the loss of a beloved pet
i look back to a year ago i feel triumphant and scared that i am finally chasing dreams
i hope you do get better please have a word with someone on the rethink helpline if you are feeling very low they may know of more help in your area
i kind of liked their rustic feel and the delicious rich taste is what these are all about anyway
i feel abused and manipulated and that i should be a mind reader
i am determined to feel gorgeous skinny and toned when i am strolling on that beach
i am not feeling sad nor anything negative
